This is my map.
Hello people,

Hear my calling and recieve my signal.
I am absorbing Python, and data science info. All this is possible thanks
to the consumption of warm liquid mostly in the form of chocolate milk.
Chocolate milk relieves temporal-fracture headaches. You might ask What's a temporal fracture?
It's a break in the time line.
